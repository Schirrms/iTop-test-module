# iTop-test-module
Just a test module with a parent - child CI and a parent-child component

I encounter a trouble with filter, and i don't know if the trouble is on my side (most probably) or if I ran in an iTop limitation.

So I create a brand new test module. It should contains a new kind of CI, lamed Test CI, and a new kind of composants, named Test Part, only available to this CI.

This is to check if a filter applied on a lnk table is applied in each case (I think not for the component).
